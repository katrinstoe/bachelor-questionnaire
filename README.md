# Info

This is a survey tool, which was created as part of my bachelor thesis, titled "Investigation of the effectiveness of
sonification in the emotional contextualization of emojis for blind and visually impaired people".
I created this tool because existing survey tools lacked efficient accessibility features such as for the overall navigation and
audio file playback.
The tool was developed for and the accessibility features were tested with visually impaired
individuals and it was used to collect data on audio recordings for the thesis.
